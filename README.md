# 🌍 Carbon Emission Prediction – AICTE–Shell Edunet Skills4Future Internship

This repository documents my work for **Weeks 1 to 3** of the **Carbon Emission Prediction** project completed under the [AICTE–Edunet Skills4Future Internship](https://internship.aicte-india.org/).  
The focus is on building AI-powered green solutions using real-world climate datasets.

---

## 📅 Weekly Progress Summary

### ✅ Week 1: Data Preparation
- Downloaded the raw climate change dataset
- Inspected and cleaned missing/inconsistent values
- Saved the cleaned dataset as `data_cleaned.csv`

### ✅ Week 2: Data Exploration & Feature Engineering
- Loaded the cleaned dataset
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized missing data using `missingno`
- Plotted feature distributions using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Analyzed feature correlations for modeling insights
- Prepared numerical features for modeling

### ✅ Week 3: Model Building & Evaluation
- Split the dataset into train and test sets
- Implemented a **Random Forest Regressor** machine learning algorithm
- Evaluated predictions using **R² Score** and **MSE**
- Documented cross-validation results
