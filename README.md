# 🌍 Carbon Emission Prediction – Edunet–Shell Skills4Future AICTE Internship

This repository documents my work for **Weeks 1 to 3** of the **Carbon Emission Prediction** project completed under the **Edunet–Shell Skills4Future AICTE Internship**, focused on **Green skills & AI**.  
The focus is on building AI-powered green solutions using real-world climate datasets.

## 📅 Weekly Progress Summary

### ✅ Week 1: Data Preparation
- Downloaded the raw climate change dataset
- Inspected and cleaned missing/inconsistent values
- Saved the cleaned dataset as `data_cleaned.csv`
- 📁 [View Week 1 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/VANISAIDEEPIKA/WEEK1-Carbon-Emissions-Prediction-.git)

### ✅ Week 2: Data Exploration & Feature Engineering
- Loaded the cleaned dataset
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized missing data using `missingno`
- Plotted feature distributions using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Analyzed feature correlations for modeling insights
- Prepared numerical features for modeling
- 📁 [View Week 2 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/VANISAIDEEPIKA/WEEK2-Carbon-Emissions-Prediction-.git)

### ✅ Week 3: Model Building & Evaluation
- Split the dataset into train and test sets
- Implemented a **Random Forest Regressor** machine learning algorithm
- Evaluated predictions using **R² Score** and **MSE**
- Documented cross-validation results

## 📘 Access Notebooks via Google Colab

> ⚠️ **Note:** GitHub may not render large `.ipynb` files properly due to size or output limitations.  
> To ensure smooth viewing of **all code, outputs, graphs, and results**, this project is fully accessible via **Google Colab**.


 ### 🔗 Open in Colab:
 📂 [notebooks_colab/](https://github.com/VANISAIDEEPIKA/WEEK-3-Carbon-Emissions-Prediction/tree/main/notebooks_colab) – Google Colab Notebooks  

---

## 💡 Why Google Colab?

I chose **Google Colab** for this project because:

- 🌐 It runs seamlessly in the cloud — no local setup headaches  
- 🧠 Handles large data & outputs better than GitHub renderer  
- 📲 Easy to **share** with mentors, reviewers & cert verifiers  
- 🚀 Ideal for showcasing Machine Learning workflows with visualizations  

> ✅ Everything is preloaded and ready-to-run with outputs preserved — no extra steps needed for verification!

## 🌱 Project Objective

This project aims to predict the CO2 emission from various parameters such as country, population-specific parameters, economic indicators, land-related, energy use, etc.  
Our aim is to clean the data, explore it, and make a predictive analysis. Using a robust algorithm, we predict the future values of GHG emissions, mainly **CO₂**.

- Leverage **AI & Machine Learning** for climate insights
- Build a robust carbon emission prediction pipeline
- Apply **Green Skills** on real-world environmental datasets

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages & Libraries**: Python 🐍, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Missingno, Scikit-learn  
- **ML Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor 🌳  
- **Notebook Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab 📓☁️  
- **Dev Tools**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) 💻

---

## 🚀 Outcome

By Week 3, a working machine learning model was built using the **Random Forest Regressor** to predict carbon emissions.  
The notebook offers a complete walkthrough — from raw data prep to model evaluation.

> 💡 *This project is a testament to how tech and sustainability go hand-in-hand.* 🌍✨
